# SDF06-CSS-LAYOUT-PRACTICE

Learning Reflections README for CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project

Project Overview:
I built a basic Instagram profile page to practice CSS layout and styling. The main focus was to create a design that looks decent on different devices.

Reflections:

What Went Well:
I implemented the practice by using Flexbox and Grid to structure my Instagram profile. Making things look appealing on both big screens and phones worked out. Styling the profile image, user information, and adding images to the gallery to resemble Instagram was a success.

Challenges:
Making everything look good on small screens was tough. I had to play around with layouts and text sizes. Adding cool hover effects needed some extra effort and research. The toughest challenge I encountered was to make the images have the same sizing.

Plans for Improvement:
I am going to learn new CSS skills and animations to make the user experience better and fun. Although my code worked, I think I can make it more visually appealing. Next time, I'll try more unique designs instead of trying to make it look the same as an Instagram profile.

Overall Experience:
Creating an Instagram profile was a blend of creativity as well as some new learning curves that I experienced.
